We are independent API-consultants.
We used to work a lot with different API description formats: RAML, API Blueprint,
OpenAPI (fka Swagger), Avro.

It was taking us tons of time to search for API specifications. That's why we have started APIs.guru project!

## Other projects
We are also working on other OpenAPI/Swagger related projects:

- [api-spec-converter](https://github.com/lucybot/api-spec-converter) (together with [lucybot](http://lucybot.com/))
- [ReDoc](https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc) (sponsored by [Rebilly](https://www.rebilly.com/))
- [generator-openapi-repo](https://github.com/Rebilly/generator-openapi-repo) (sponsored by [Rebilly](https://www.rebilly.com/))
