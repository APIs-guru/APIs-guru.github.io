We started APIs.guru year and a half ago with the goal to build a catalog of machine-readable API definitions or how we like to call it "Wikipedia for Web APIs".
Initially, we did the proof of concept implementation and added the starting set of 200+ API specs.
And as the result, we get our first [integrations](https://github.com/APIs-guru/api-models#existing-integrations) and proved our main point that API ecosystem will benefit from such catalog.
​

In the last couple of months, we will be working on the things that allow other people to contribute more easily. A great example is our new form for submitting APIs and we will continue to work in that direction.
​

But all of this effort don't make any sense if people don't know about our project or don't understand what we are trying to build.
We do need to answer some basic questions like: what is APIs.guru? why are we building it? what is end goal?
Exactly for this purpose, we started this blog and more articles are coming in next weeks.
​
Meanwhile,  you can read [our guest post](http://swagger.io/apis-guru-wikipedia-for-web-apis/) at `swagger.io` and a few 3rd-party articles:
