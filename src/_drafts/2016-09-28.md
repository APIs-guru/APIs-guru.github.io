We just returned to Ukraine from our first trip to the USA.
The most exiting part was [RestFest](https://2016.restfest.org/us/) conference in Greenville, SC.

It was great opportunity to speak with API experts and also to make a few presentations.

## JSON Schema MegaWAT

**Description**: I work with JSON Schema almost every day, so I've already accepted all its strange quirks.
But quite often (GitHub, forums, clients) I see the same mistakes and misunderstanding.
I'd like to show all these quirks in the form of funny WAT talk.
As a bonus, I'd like to discuss the alternative format I'm currently working on.

## From API Directory to Semantic Web
**Description**: When it comes to SemanticWeb we see the forest for the trees by only associating it with academia-developed standards like RDF, OWL, etc.
But today more and more companies are using API specifications(OpenAPI/Swagger, RAML, API Blueprint, ...) as they provide benefits on their own: API consoles, generating Docs & SDKs, testing.
Can we use these API specification to build SemanticWeb?
As the first step, I working on [APIs.guru](https://APIs.guru) directory of [OpenAPI](https://openapis.org/) spec and I want to
share my vision how we can use it to build [The Next Web](https://www.ted.com/talks/tim_berners_lee_on_the_next_web?language=en).

Organisazers of @RestFest prepare great networking event for all 3 evening of the conference.
It gave us a lot of oportunities to disscuss API related stuff and get some feedback about APIs.guru
We had exceptionaly long and interesting conversation with [Jerome Louvel](https://github.com/RESTFest/2016-Greenville/wiki/Jerome-Louvel) founder of Restlet who share our passition for bees and APIs:

Besides API related things we unknowingly took part in [David Gardner](https://github.com/RESTFest/2016-Greenville/wiki/David-Gardner) social experement:
