    <p>As you probably know, we are absolutely in love with GitHub.
We host 100% of our projects there and try to promote GitHub among our friends and customers. That&rsquo;s why we are happy that more and more developers choose to publish their API specifications on GitHub. In our quest to catch all <del>pokemons</del> specifications we&rsquo;ve discovered that nearly one-third of specifications in our directory were found on GitHub!</p>

<p>Many big companies have followed this trend: <a href="https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-oai">SendGrid</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-api-spec">Dropbox</a>, <a href="https://github.com/spotify/web-api">Spotify</a>.
Even Microsoft has published <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs">Azure OpenAPI specificatoins</a> on GitHub. Need we say more?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s very easy to publish your specifications on GitHub and instantly get <a href="https://github.com/Rebilly/generator-openapi-repo#why">many benefits</a> from this.
But at some point, every API owner has to write scripts for: bundling, validation, deployment, etc.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why we got excited when Rebilly inc. contracted us to create <a href="https://github.com/Rebilly/RebillyAPI">GitHub repo</a> for their OpenAPI spec.
This opportunity allowed us to develop <a href="http://yeoman.io/">Yeoman</a> generator for GitHub repository that has many exciting <a href="https://github.com/Rebilly/generator-openapi-repo#features">features</a> for API owners.
And that&rsquo;s how <a href="https://github.com/Rebilly/generator-openapi-repo">generator-openapi-repo</a> was born.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Rebilly/generator-openapi-repo"><img src="/assets/images/blog/generator-openapi-repo.png" alt="generator-openapi-repo"></a></p>

<p>With our generator, you need only 20 minutes to generate full featured API repository on GitHub.</p>
